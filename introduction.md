# Introduction

[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source web framework created for [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. It allows developers to build modern web applications in Kotlin.

## Main features

#### Compiled and strongly typed programming language

Kotlin is a modern programming language released in 2016 by JetBrains. It's a statically typed language with many great, practical features and outstanding tooling support \(IntelliJ IDEA\).

#### Object oriented, imperative design

KVision allows you to build modern web applications with the Kotlin language, without any use of HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

KVision prefers the imperative style of programming. It's object oriented and supports many well known OOP design patterns. It gives you a hierarchy of consistent components, which are used as a builder blocks for the application GUI. The classes you can just use in your project or which you can extend to modify their default behavior.

KVision's design is quite similar to many non-web UI programming libraries including Swing, JavaFX, QT, WinForms and Flutter.

#### **Ready to use components**

* sophisticated containers \(tabs, stack, dock, grid, horizontal, vertical, flexbox, responsive\)
* forms with type-safe data model and built-in validation
* many different text input components including rich text editor
* buttons, checkboxes and radios
* date and time picker
* spinner
* advanced select box with ajax support
* file upload with preview and multi-selection
* advanced charts
* reactive tables
* data binding components with observable data model
* navigation bar, toolbar and context menu
* tooltips and popovers
* modals including ready to use alerts and confirm dialogs
* floating, re-sizable windows
* many HTML components including tables, lists, images, canvas and iframe
* built-in support for [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) templates 
* built-in support for [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons
* built-in support for [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* built-in support for [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library
* built-in support for [Pace](https://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) automatic page loader

#### Flexibility

KVision was designed to be open and flexible. By default it gives you [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) based look & feel. You can also use themes from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) or you can disable them all and design your application appearance from the scratch, limited only by your own knowledge of CSS.

KVision is open source and modular. You can create your own modules taking an example from quite a few already existing. Almost all KVision classes are declared as open. With inheritance and composition you can build your own components, with all new features you need in your apps.

KVision is suitable for any kind of projects, including responsive, mobile web applications or even a simple, plain websites.

#### Server side interface

KVision contains innovative connectivity interface for three popular server side frameworks - [Ktor](https://ktor.io), [Jooby](https://jooby.org/) and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), which allows to build full-stack, multiplatform applications with shared common code. KVision closely integrates the client and the server side of the project with a shared data model and fully type-safe connectivity between both sides \(based on automatically generated routings and JSON-RPC endpoints\). This architecture is based on Kotlin coroutines, wrapping asynchronous client-server calls into easy-to-read synchronous-like code. This makes KVision full-stack applications very easy to create and maintain.

There is also experimental support for type-safe websocket connections, based on [Kotlin coroutines channels](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/channels.html).

#### Other features

* Utilizes [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) fast virtual DOM implementation
* Type safe DSL builders
* Internationalization support based on [Jed](http://messageformat.github.io/Jed/) library and [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) translations
* Drag & drop support
* Type-safe REST connectivity
* Integrated JS router
* Support for building hybrid, mobile applications for Android and iOS with [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).
* Support for building cross-platform, desktop applications with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).
* Compatible with modern browsers \(MS Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera\)
* [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) testing framework support
