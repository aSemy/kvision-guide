# Introduction

[KVision](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision) is an open source Web UI framework created for [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language. It allows developers to build modern web applications in Kotlin.

## Main features

#### Compiled and strongly typed programming language

Kotlin is a modern programming language released in 2016 by JetBrains. It's a statically typed language with many great, practical features and outstanding tooling support \(IntelliJ IDEA\).

#### Object oriented, imperative design

Unlike most of the popular web frameworks \(AngularJS, React, Vue.js and others\), KVision is not declarative - it is not designed to mix HTML code \(or pseudo code\) with a typical programming language. In KVision everything is just written in Kotlin. KVision gives you a hierarchy of consistent components, which you can just use in your project or which you can extend to modify their default behavior.

#### **Ready to use components**

* sophisticated containers \(tabs, stack, dock, grid, horizontal, vertical, flexbox, responsive\)
* forms with type-safe data model and built-in validation
* many different text input components including rich text editor
* buttons, checkboxes and radios
* date and time picker
* spinner
* advanced select box with ajax support
* file upload with preview and multi-selection
* data binding components with observable data model
* navigation bar, toolbar and context menu
* modals including ready to use alerts and confirm dialogs
* floating, re-sizable windows
* many HTML components including tables, lists, images, canvas and iframe
* built-in support for [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) templates and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons

#### Suitable for any application

KVision was designed to be open and flexible. By default it gives you [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) based look & feel. You can also use themes from [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/) or you can disable them all and design your application appearance from the scratch, limited only by your own knowledge of CSS.

Ability to implement a fully compatible [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) application, which you can find in the [KVision-examples](https://github.com/rjaros/kvision-examples) repository, proves that KVision is suitable for any kind of projects, including responsive, mobile web applications or even a simple, plain websites.

#### Server side interface

KVision contains innovative connectivity interface for [Jooby](https://jooby.org/) micro web framework on the server side, which allows to build full-stack, multiplatform applications with shared common code. KVision closely integrates the client and the server side of the project with a shared data model and fully type-safe connectivity between both sides \(based on automatically generated routings and JSON-RPC endpoints\). This architecture is based on Kotlin coroutines, wrapping asynchronous client-server calls into easy-to-read synchronous-like code. This makes KVision full-stack applications very easy to create and maintain.

#### Other features

* Utilizes [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) fast virtual DOM implementation
* Type safe DSL builders
* Drag & drop support
* Integrated JS router
* [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/) testing framework support
