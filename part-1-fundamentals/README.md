# Part 1: Fundamentals

This section will cover everything you will need to get started with KVision. This part is designed to be read sequentially, as concepts may build on top of each other.

Note:  
This part focuses on client side applications and does not address building full-stack, multi-platform KVision applications. See [Part 3 of the Guide](../part-3-server-side-interface.md) for this topic.
